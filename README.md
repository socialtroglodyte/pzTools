# pzTools - Mod File Management for Project Zomboid

pzTools is a program that allows you to create, edit, and delete mod files with a much more streamline workflow.

In it's current state, It is what I would consider a very primitive prototype that I will expand upon in future releases. It currently uses a text user interface rather than a traditional graphic user interface, which is currently being developed. For now, I use it as a fast method of setting up PZ mod file structures.
